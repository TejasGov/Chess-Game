# Chess-Game
Basic Chess Game
A simple, two-player web-based chess game built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a comprehensive example of building a full-featured game with core web technologies.

Features
Complete Game Logic: Includes full movement rules for all pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).

Move Validation: Prevents any move that would leave the player's king in check.

Check and Checkmate: Detects when a player is in check and ends the game when a checkmate occurs.

Castling: Supports kingside and queenside castling with all standard rules enforced.

Accessible Design: Includes a Light Mode and Dark Mode toggle for improved readability and user preference.

Game Over Screen: Displays a celebratory message with a confetti animation and a "Play Again" button to easily restart the game.

Board Coordinates: Features standard chess algebraic notation (A1-H8) for easy move tracking.

How to Play
Ensure all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) are in the same directory.

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Click on one of your pieces and then click on a valid square to move it. Valid moves will be highlighted.

Built With
HTML5: For the game's structure.

CSS3: For all styling, including the board, pieces, and light/dark modes.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the entire game engine and interactive logic.
